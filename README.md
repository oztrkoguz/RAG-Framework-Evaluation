## RAG-Framework-Evaluation

![workflow2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c766cd45-2b55-41db-9929-a6c0d1fae8e7)

### This project aims to compare different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. Using the same document and model, we evaluate LlamaIndex, Autogen, Langchain, Swarm and Crewai frameworks in terms of speed, accuracy and performance. These evaluations will help determine which framework is more effective in certain scenarios.
